## Introduction
Welcome and thank you for using Sparkle, a lightweight, responsive, open-source CSS framework created to help Web Designers and Developers create simple, responsive websites. It was developed by J. Djimitry Riviere in late 2016, and continues to be improved upon by its developer. The major key to this framework lies within its ease of use to deliver superb results when designing apps and websites.

## Getting Started
There are 4 ways to get started with the Sparkle framework:
1. Clone your own copy (P.S.: If you wish to contribute to this project, be sure to read description below);
2. Download the .ZIP file;
3. Link the latest release directly into your HTML file by inserting the following lines to your HTML file: 
```html
<head>
    <!-- Your links, sources, title, and meta tags here -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://gitcdn.link/repo/jdriviere/sparkle-css/master/dist/css/sparkle.min.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your body scripts here -->
    <script src="https://gitcdn.link/repo/jdriviere/sparkle-css/master/dist/js/sparkle.min.js"></script>
</body>
```
(You will need both links to ensure Sparkle works efficiently, as it uses the jQuery.)

4. Download the Node Package Manager (NPM) into your folder:
```
npm install sparkle.css
```
